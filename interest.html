        <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
        <p>
            For as long as I can remember I have always had a bit of technology surrounding me. Didn’t help the fact that my Dad works in IT and shares the same love for tech as myself. He and I would always geek out about computer parts, a new video game console or a new phone releasing. I have some very fond memories of my dad and I playing new games together.
            I chose to come to RMIT as I have a fair few friends studying here and have all said very positive things about RMIT.
            I expect to learn a fair bit as I don’t have much knowledge about IT and programming. Looking forward to learning the basics or java, html and css. Would love to learn how to work in groups better as I was normally the person who would only contribute last minute, will be making sure I don’t do that here.
