                <p> This job combines two of my dream jobs in one! Programming and game development.
                    From what I can understand this job it requires me to work on the user interface for the games this company works on.
                    It requires knowledge of Xaml, WPF, Blend, C# and C++. The job also requires two years of experience in UI/UX development. Of the above requirements I have knowledge in none of them.
                    These skills I will have to develop over the next few years to even be considered for a job like this. 
                    I planned on using this intro to IT + programming as a bridge to see what kind of field of IT I want to work in, currently loving the programming so after these 12 weeks I will either continue this course or find a programming course to further my knowledge and eventually end up in a similar job to this
