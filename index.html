        Hey there I’m Matt! 
Little bit about myself. I currently working in hospitality part time and have been taking a “gap year” for the past two and half years since I finished high school. Obviously due to current events I haven’t been able to work. And due to that I have decided to bring my gap years to an end.
I’m a typical high school drop out who ended up going to VCAL. Now I have realised that I didn’t learn much/anything during my time in VCAL, and now would like to further my knowledge.
Always been a bit of a nerd so this IT course seemed perfect for me and thanks to OUA I didn’t need to have any prerequisites to apply.

    <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
    <article>
        For as long as I can remember I have always had a bit of technology surrounding me. Didn’t help the fact that my Dad works in IT and shares the same love for tech as myself. He and I would always geek out about computer parts, a new video game console or a new phone releasing. I have some very fond memories of my dad and I playing new games together.
        I chose to come to RMIT as I have a fair few friends studying here and have all said very positive things about RMIT.
        I expect to learn a fair bit as I don’t have much knowledge about IT and programming. Looking forward to learning the basics or java, html and css. Would love to learn how to work in groups better as I was normally the person who would only contribute last minute, will be making sure I don’t do that here.
